 # Eureka.
![sample](Phases/Phase 4/asset.png)

We are a generation characterized by procrastination.
One solution and solution to this, commonly used by students and not only, are the study cafes.
There, a load of reading/work is done, which under other circumstances at home would not be completed, or at least not at this degree.
This is something we talk to you derived from experience and confirmed by scientific articles.
The current readme.md that you read now is been written in "tag", a well-known study cafe in Patras.

However, a problem that arises is that not all of our acquaintances are comfortable with the reading room and we end up going solo, if we go, which is not that efficient.
And that's something normal and perfectly understandable. Either because they can't focus together with so many people, or because they arrange with groups that have joint labs,
 or because in the end the ours doesn't add up.

So first as students and then as computer engineers,
we came up with Eureka, the first Greek study buddy finder app.
