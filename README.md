We are a generation characterized by procrastination. 🥱
One solution and trend to this, commonly used by students and not only, are the study cafes.
There, a lot of reading/work is done, which under other circumstances at home would not be completed, or at least not at this level.
This is something you may take from us as granted, considering from our experience as well as from the scientific articles mentioned.
Even the current README.md is being written in "Tag", a well-known study cafe in Patras.

However, a problem that arises is that not all of our friends are comfortable with the study cafes and we end up going solo, if we even go, which is not that efficient.
And that's something normal and perfectly understandable. Either because they can't focus together with so many people, or because they arrange with groups that have joint labs,
or because in the end the hour themselves don't add up.

So first as students and then as computer engineers,
we came up with Eureka, the first Greek study buddy finder app. 🫂✒️

## Disclaimer

Eureka was created as a University Project for the Department of Computer Engineering & Informatics. As such, it is not a fully functional software product, yet 🥵, and it's not meant for commercial use. The main objective of the undergraduate course was familiarising ourselves with agile workflows and not the functionality of the app which however we have implementated to a significant degree.
